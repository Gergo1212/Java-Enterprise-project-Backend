# It library

## Java-Enterprise-project-Backend

This is an online it library simulation.
The backend is a Java Spring application which uses Spring Security for user authentication. 
The data are persisted using Hibernate and PostgreSQL.
We use an outside api to initialise our library with some books.

The frontend is React.
The frontend is on a different repository: https://github.com/tothmate911/Java-Enterprise-project-Frontend.
